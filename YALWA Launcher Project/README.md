Description:
Quick launch tool for the company I work for, equiped with links to pages the moderator staff uses on a daily basis, such as (Ad and image review dashboards), quick links to the training platform and a PDF viewer with tips to help moderators review submissions more successfully. each icon is linked to the webpages associated with its image.

my inspiration for this app came from loosing pages through out the day and sometimes having to scroll endlessly through my history to find it agian, ESPECIALLY PDF's containing pertinent information, necessary to our work on a daily basis. i thought it would be great to have the training portal at hand instead of having to scroll through bookmarks, especially if you have ALOT of bookmarks in your browser. convenience was in mind when making the extension and i wanted my coworkers (and myself) to have it easier on a daily basis with regards to having all the tools needed to perform optimallyoptimally right at our finger tips.

iI wanted to launch the app on google chrome, but willplanning to go with firefox first, only because its the preferred browser of my cohorts. eventually it will be made available on google chrome, most likely sometime in August 2022.
